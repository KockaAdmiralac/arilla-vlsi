# Arilla components
This directory contains the basic building blocks which make Arilla - registers, multiplexers, decoders, etc. Some of them were generated using Quartus megafunctions, some of them were written in VHDL and some of them were created as block diagrams.

We won't explain what each of them does because we do not know either at this point.
