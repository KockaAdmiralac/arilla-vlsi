ARILLA BEST PRACTICES:
Single bit const signals should not be named '0' and '1', they should be named zero and one instead
When generating components: generate them in components folder from components project and make sure they are included in components project
Generate megafunctions using VHDL and only generate required files (.vhd and .bsf)
Microcode .mif files should be placed in mic folder while .vhd async ROM files belong in folder of the project in which they are used
Feel free to resurect asm folder for .asm and machine code .mif files
