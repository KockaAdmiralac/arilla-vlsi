# Arilla Tools
Here are the tools used while developing Arilla.
- `LineDrawerSimulator`: A simulator used while creating the line drawer, used to compare C#'s line drawing algorithm with Arilla's
- `mifgen`: Used to convert files with hex values (from RARS) into MIF files
- `PeripheralSimulator`: Used to simulate peripherals while testing Paint
- `SRAMMifgen`: Used to convert `objdump` output into MIF files for feeding into the SRAM (putting the program into memory)
